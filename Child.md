# Child Development Plan: Task Creation

## Overview
This plan outlines detailed instructions to implement a secure and reliable endpoint for creating tasks within a Next.js application. The endpoint should validate input, store task data in a database, and respond with appropriate status codes and messages.

---

## Steps

### 1. Set Up API Route
- [ ] **Create a new API route file** for task creation in `pages/api/tasks/create.js` (or `.ts` for TypeScript).
  - [ ] Structure the file to export a default asynchronous function as required by Next.js API routes.

### 2. Configure Database Connection
- [ ] **Set up a connection to the database** (e.g., using a library like `prisma` or `mongoose` for MongoDB).
  - [ ] Import database client or connection settings at the top of `create.js`.
  - [ ] Configure environment variables in `.env` for database connection credentials.
  - [ ] Add error handling for potential connection issues.

### 3. Implement Input Validation
- [ ] **Validate incoming task data** to ensure required fields are provided and meet expected formats.
  - **Required fields**:
    - `title` (string)
    - `description` (string, optional)
    - `priority` (integer, e.g., 1-5)
    - `dueDate` (ISO date string, optional)
  - [ ] Use a validation library (e.g., `yup` or `joi`) or custom validation logic to check the format of each field.
  - [ ] If validation fails, return a `400 Bad Request` status with a descriptive error message.

### 4. Implement Task Creation Logic
- [ ] **Check HTTP method** to ensure it is a `POST` request.
  - [ ] If the method is not `POST`, return a `405 Method Not Allowed` status.
- [ ] **Parse request body** to extract task data.
  - [ ] Ensure secure parsing by handling JSON parsing errors.
- [ ] **Insert task into the database**:
  - [ ] Construct the task object with validated fields.
  - [ ] Use a `create` operation with the database client to insert the task into the database.
  - [ ] Ensure any sensitive data or fields not intended for direct exposure are excluded from the response.

### 5. Send Response
- [ ] **Return success response** upon successful creation:
  - [ ] Return a `201 Created` status with the created task object.
- [ ] **Error handling**:
  - [ ] If task creation fails due to a database error, return a `500 Internal Server Error` with a generic error message.
  - [ ] Log specific errors for troubleshooting.

### 6. Security Considerations
- [ ] **Input validation**: Ensure all fields are validated to prevent SQL injection or NoSQL injection attacks.
- [ ] **Authentication and authorization**:
  - [ ] Verify that the request includes an authenticated user session (e.g., using NextAuth).
  - [ ] Ensure tasks are associated with the authenticated user's ID.
  - [ ] If unauthenticated, return a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- [ ] **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the task creation endpoint (e.g., using middleware like `express-rate-limit`).

## Example Folder Structure
To ensure a clear file organization, consider structuring the project as follows:

    /pages
      /api
        /tasks
          create.js       // Task creation endpoint
          update.js       // Task update endpoint (for reference)
          delete.js       // Task delete endpoint (for reference)
    /lib
      /db.js             // Database connection settings
      /validation.js     // Reusable validation logic

---

## Testing Plan for Task Creation

### 1. Unit Tests
- [ ] Write tests for **input validation** to verify correct handling of valid and invalid task data.
- [ ] Test **database interaction** to confirm task creation logic works with the database client.

### 2. Integration Tests
- [ ] Test **end-to-end task creation** via the API route to verify:
  - Successful creation of a task with valid data.
  - Appropriate response status and message for invalid data.
  - Behavior for unauthenticated requests.

### 3. Security Tests
- [ ] Test **unauthorized access** by attempting to create tasks without authentication.
- [ ] Test **rate limiting** to confirm the endpoint correctly limits requests from a single user.
